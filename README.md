# Lab-Challenge
This is my implementation for Udacity Pytorch Challenge Scholarship Project. 
It is an image classifier that classifies flower images. 
The used dataset is Oxford's 102 flower dataset. 
I used pretrained model (resnet152) and changed the classifier to a one fully connected layer with dropout. 
I freezed conv layers and trained the model. 
accuracy : 92%
